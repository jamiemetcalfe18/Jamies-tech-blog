# Jamie's Tech Blog

![Image of the blog](https://i.imgur.com/SPSE5Ef.png)

This is a blog made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and the [Chripy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/). This was my first time using a static site generator. I found it pretty straightforward and easy to use! I really enjoyed it and would recommend Jekyll to anyone looking to start a blog. The docs are so clean and straightforward. 

## What I Learned

I got a lot of practice with the command line, as with Jekyll you use the command line to set it up and launch a local server to preview changes. I also got some good practice adding .YML files and with file structure. I use Ubuntu as my development environment so got more practice with that and using git as well! I had some deployment errors with github, which I had to troubleshoot and overall this project was a good exercise and practice using something new I've never done before. 

## Why a blog?

I was told starting a blog is a good way to get people interested in your work and share your progress. So here it is! My attempt to do so! It is also good to practice writing to get better and more efficent at communicating.
