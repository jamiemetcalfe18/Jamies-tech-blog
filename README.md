# Jamie's Tech Blog

This is a blog made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and the [Chripy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/). This was my first time using a static site generator. I found it pretty straightforward and easy to use! I really enjoyed it and would reccomend Jekyll to anyone looking to start a blog. The docs are so clean and straightforward. 

## What I Learned

I got a lot of practice with the command line, as with Jekyll you use the command line to set it up and launch a local server to preview changes. I also got some good practice adding .YML files and with file structure. I use Ubuntu as my development enviroment so got more practice with that and using git as well! I had some deplyment errors with github, which I had to troubleshoot and overall this project was a good excersize and practice using something new I've never done before. 

## Why a blog?

I was told starting a blog is a good way to get people interested in your work and share your progress. So here it is! My attempt to do so!
