<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Jamie Metcalfe, a New Orleans native with a passion for technology and computers. Currently, I am pursuing my Associate's degree in Computer Information Technology at Delgado Community College, where I have maintained a commendable 3.0 GPA. My concentration lies in Web Development, and I take pride in being an Adobe Certified Associate in web design and Photoshop.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I hold a Comptia Cloud+ certification and possess a technical certificate in Cloud Computing, Web Design, and Technical Programming from my college. These qualifications reflect my dedication to expanding my knowledge and expertise in the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>

<p>In my free time, you'll find me engrossed in learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends. Additionally, I love staying active by working out and going on long walks in nature. By my side throughout these adventures is my faithful companion, BabyGirl, a 14-year-old black Labrador.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out to me through my blog's linked socials or my Discord handle, oceanx18. I'm always open to connecting, chatting, and discussing anything related to my passions and interests.</p>
