<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Jamie Metcalfe, a 29-year-old New Orleans native with a passion for technology and computers. Currently, I am pursuing my Associate's degree in Computer Information Technology at Delgado Community College, where I have maintained a commendable 3.0 GPA. My concentration lies in Web Development, and I take pride in being an Adobe Certified Associate in web design and Photoshop.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I hold a Comptia Cloud+ certification and possess a technical certificate in Cloud Computing from my college. These qualifications reflect my dedication to expanding my knowledge and expertise in the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>

<p>In my free time, you'll find me engrossed in learning new things and staying up-to-date with the latest trends. Additionally, I love staying active by working out and going on long walks in nature. By my side throughout these adventures is my faithful companion, BabyGirl, a 14-year-old black Labrador.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out to me through my blog's linked socials or my Discord handle, Ocean#0007. I'm always open to connecting, chatting, and discussing anything related to my passions and interests.</p>
